# xmling

An attempt to see what it's like to parse an xml document in clojure

[data.xml](https://github.com/clojure/data.xml)
[data.zip](https://clojure.github.io/data.zip/)
[clojure.zip](https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.zip-api.html)

inspired by [this post](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/tutorials/parsing_xml_with_zippers.html)

At first glance, it looks and feels as good as a linq query. However, I am having trouble with namespaces.

Diving into the [tickets](http://dev.clojure.org/jira/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&jqlQuery=project+%3D+DXML+AND+%28summary+~+xmlns+OR+description+~+xmlns%29+ORDER+BY+status+DESC%2C+priority+DESC) it appears that namespaces still are not well supported.
